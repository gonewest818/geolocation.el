;;; Commentary:

;; This package obtains your current location by obtaining the MAC
;; addresses of nearby wifi access points and then submitting that
;; list to third-party geolocation APIs.  Those geolocation services
;; use the known locations of the wifi access points and the relative
;; strength of each signal to triangulate your latitude and longitude.

;; The main entry points are:

;; - `geolocation-get-position' which returns your estimated position as
;;   an alist with the following keys:
;;   - `lat' - latitude of the current position
;;   - `lon' - longitude of the current position
;;   - `accuracy' - an error radius, in meters

;; - `geolocation-scan-wifi' which scans for nearby wifi access points
;;   using available system utilites, and produces a complete list of
;;   everything in range sorted by signal strength.
;;   Returns a list of alists containing:
;;   - `bssid' - mac address that uniquely identifies the AP
;;   - `signal' - relative signal strength, or RSSI
;;   - `channel' - transmission channel
;;   At present, wifi scanning is supported on Mac OSX and Windows.
;;   Linux support is planned but not yet implemented.

;; You have a choice of third party services to use for the positioning:

;; - Google Maps Geolocation API
;;   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro

;; - Unwired Labs Location API
;;   https://unwiredlabs.com/home

;; This package offers a set of customizable variables you can use to
;; select which service is used, declare your API access token, choose
;; the nearest API endpoint, and so on.  Those settings can be found in
;; `M-x customize`, then browse for "Environment", then "hardware", and
;; then "Geolocation".

;; By default, access tokens are expected to be accessed via the built-in
;; `auth-source` package.  You can configure any backend, as this package
;; only requires the token to be searchable via
;; `auth-source-pick-first-password`.

;; Rate Limits and Costs:

;; Each of these services requires you to create your own account, and
;; potentially provide billing information as well.  You will be agreeing
;; to the vendor's end-user agreements including such things as
;; acceptable usage policies and privacy terms, when you create your
;; account.

;; Care has been taken to choose services that include either a free
;; tier, or equivalently, an allowance of a certain amount of usage per
;; day or per month.  It's your responsibility to set up your account
;; with those services, obtain and protect your token, and manage your
;; usage of those APIs because there can be associated costs if your
;; usage exceeds the usage terms of the subscription or plan you choose.

;; WARNING: THIS PACKAGE COLLECTS INFORMATION THAT IMPLIES YOUR PHYSICAL
;; LOCATION.  THAT DATA WILL BE SENT TO THIRD-PARTY GEOLOCATION SERVICES
;; WHICH CAN PINPOINT YOUR LOCATION TYPICALLY WITHIN 100 METERS OR LESS.
;; WHILE THIS PACKAGE DOES NOT ITSELF STORE YOUR LOCATION, WE CANNOT
;; GUARANTEE WHAT A GIVEN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE MAY DO WITH THE DATA IT
;; RECEIVES IN THESE API TRANSACTIONS.  RATHER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
;; TO THE PRIVACY AGREEMENTS AND END USER AGREEMENTS OF EACH OF THE
;; INDIVIDUAL GEOLOCATION APIS YOU USE.
